# Forkify:

This is the final project of The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

## Project Overview and Planning:

this application is about searching for recipes and displaying them in the UI

### A user will input a search term

- if there are > 10 results they will be shown on multiple pages
- if a result is selected the UI will update to show that specific recipe's details
- the list of ingredients will dynamically update based on the selected number of servings
- there will also be a link to the page of the recipe

- a user will be able to bookmark recipes
- a user will be able to create thier own recipes (will only be visible to that specific user)

## 3/8/2022:

- will focus on uploading files and initiating the project correctly and uploading to repo.

## 3/9/2022:
- will create a funcion that allows us to get a recipe from the API, reformats the data that we recieve from our AJAX call, and loads the recipe to the UI
